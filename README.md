This simulation requires OPENCV in c++ to run.

This simulation doesn't take friction into account, as it was meant to check estimated behaviour of algorithms like pid.
This simulation is best to check behavior of bot's movements based on image processing.

For some idea on how to use the code, see the pdf file in repo.
